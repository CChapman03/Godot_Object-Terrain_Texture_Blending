# Godot_Object-Terrain_Texture_Blending
Testing blending objects/assets with Terrain so that nature scenes look more realistic.

Currently using textures and 3d rock model from https://files.sharetextures.com for initial testing.
The terrain model I created myself in blender, but it has textures applied from the same above source.

Ideally, I want to find a way to sample the texture of any object or terrain to the rock/asset using vertex world positions somehow.
This is a work-in-progress.
